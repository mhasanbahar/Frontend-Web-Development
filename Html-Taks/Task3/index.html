    <!--How to make manti-->
    <h2>Manti Making Stage</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a deep mixing bowl, add 3.5 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of salt. Mix and create a well in the center of the flour.</li>
        <li>Add 1 egg into the center and continue mixing. Slowly incorporate 1 cup of lukewarm water while stirring.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until it reaches a consistency that is neither too firm nor too soft. Cover the ready dough with plastic wrap and let it rest.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, in another suitable mixing bowl, add 250 grams of lean minced meat. Then, add 1 medium-sized onion, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Mix the ingredients thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a floured surface and shape it by kneading. Divide the dough into three equal parts.</li>
        <li>Turn the divided dough into small balls. On the floured surface, roll out each ball with a rolling pin to form thick sheets.</li>
        <li>Cut the rolled-out dough into small squares using a knife. Place small portions of the prepared minced meat mixture in the center of each square.</li>
        <li>Fold the four corners of the dough to the center, giving it a dumpling shape. Place the shaped mantı on a floured tray. Freeze the tray to solidify the mantı.</li>
        <li>After removing the frozen mantı from the freezer, transfer them to plastic bags with double locks and store them in the freezer for later use. Boil water in a suitable pot.</li>
        <li>Cook the frozen mantı in boiling water for about 15-20 minutes. In a saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter, then add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared tomato paste sauce into the cooked mantı and continue cooking while stirring. Place the cooked mantı on a deep plate and pour garlic or regular yogurt over them. Your mantı recipe is ready. You can serve it with added red pepper flakes, mint, and sumac.</li>
